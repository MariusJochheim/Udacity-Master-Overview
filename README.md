## Agentic AI

[Course Overview Page](https://www.udacity.com/course/agentic-ai--nd900)

**Description by Udacity**

Go beyond single chatbots to engineer sophisticated, coordinated teams of AI agents. This Nanodegree guides you from advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and ReAct to designing agentic workflows with patterns like Routing and Parallelization. You'll master building and orchestrating agents in Python that can reason, plan, and use tools to interact with databases and external APIs. Build a powerful portfolio by tackling hands-on projects, including a multi-agent travel planner, an AI-powered project manager, and a fully automated sales system, to solve real-world problems.

### Flower Classifier

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MariusJochheim/Udacity-Master-Flower-Classifier)

Build a Python application that can train an image classifier on a dataset, then predict new images using the trained model.

## Data Analyst

[Course Overview Page](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

**Description by Udacity**

Clean up messy data, uncover patterns and insights, and communicate your findings. You'll start with an introduction to data analysis tools, including Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. Using these tools, you will ask questions about data and answer them through data collection, exploration, wrangling, and visualization. This intermediate-level program includes real-world projects where you will choose your own datasets, research questions, and analysis approach. As you progress through the program, each course will repeat the data analysis process while introducing more advanced techniques, such as applying data imputation to fill in missing data and applying appropriate encodings when developing data visualizations.
